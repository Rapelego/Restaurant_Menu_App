In this part of the project, several enhancements were made to improve the design and functionality of the Restaurant Menu App:

â€¢ Introduced a reusable style design for all app buttons.
â€¢ Added new images to the Home, Add Item, and Filter screens for visual enhancement.
â€¢ Improved navigation between screens (Home, Add Item, Filter).

â€¢ Home Screen: Displays menu items, total count, and navigation buttons.
â€¢ Add Item Screen: Allows the user to input dish details and save them to the menu.
